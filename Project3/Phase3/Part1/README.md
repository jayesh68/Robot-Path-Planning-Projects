Steps to run the program:
1. Copy the script proj3_part1_final.py to your machine.
2. Run the command python3_part1_final.py in your interpreter.
3. Enter the start node, orientation, the two RPMs and the the goal coordinates.
4. The map has been set to a 1000x1000 (100cmx100cm)scale. So the start and goal nodes should be entered in terms of cm.
5. The pygame animation would begin once the inputs are entered by the user. 
6. Once the goal node is reached the backtracked path would be drawn in pygame.
7. The matplotlib visualizations would load once the backtracking is complete.
8. .mp4 file has been uploaded in the same folder
