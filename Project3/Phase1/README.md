HOW TO RUN The Mobile Robot Search: Project 3 Phase 1

a) Download python scricpt into a given path/folder


b) Make sure all of the sourced python files are downloaded into the same folder
    ie, actionSet.py
c) Finally, run p3_dij_rig.py in a python interpretor
d) Follow User interactive instructions to search for start and goal nodes in the given environment
    - enter the start nodes as instructed; 
    - Then enter the desired location (goal node) of the point robot;
    - Any node outside the environment is out of bound or inside the obstacle space is
      not allowed, and will redirect you to the same selection prompt
    - Dijkstra search will begin and print confirmation statement at the end
    - Animation will be shown once the exploration and backtracking is complete
    - After the goal node in the animation is reached, visualization of the backtracking will be shown drawing the optimal path
    - Search will terminate by printing total computation time.
e) Close python interpreter when done.
